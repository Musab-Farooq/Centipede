# 🎮 Centipede Game (C++ & SFML)

A classic arcade-style shooter game built using **C++** and the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. In this fast-paced action game, you must destroy a slithering centipede and a rogue spider before they reach your player — all while avoiding mushrooms and earning high scores!

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

Take control of the player at the bottom of the screen. Your mission: **survive waves of centipede segments and a roaming spider**. Use quick reflexes, precise aim, and smart movement to survive and score as high as possible!

### 🎯 Features

- **Classic Arcade Mechanics**  
  - Centipede moves in a zigzag pattern, splits when hit.
  - Mushrooms act as obstacles and can be shot.
  - Spider roams the screen unpredictably for added challenge.

- **Pixel-style Graphics**  
  Clean, sprite-based visuals rendered using SFML.

- **Immersive Audio**  
  Background music and effects (shooting, collisions, game-over) create a retro vibe.

- **Game Loop**  
  Smooth frame updates, input handling, and real-time enemy behavior using SFML.

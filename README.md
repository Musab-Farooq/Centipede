# Centipede Game
A classic arcade-style game built using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). In this game, players control a character that must dodge a fast-moving centipede and a roaming spider while shooting to destroy them before they reach the player. The game features:

Gameplay: Navigate a grid-based arena, avoid obstacles like mushrooms, and shoot to eliminate centipede segments and the spider. Score points by hitting enemies and mushrooms.
Graphics: Pixel-art style visuals with sprites for the player, centipede, spider, mushrooms, and bullets, rendered using SFML.
Audio: Background music and sound effects for shooting and player death, enhancing the immersive experience.
Mechanics: The centipede moves in a zigzag pattern, splitting when hit, and mushrooms act as obstacles. The spider moves unpredictably, adding challenge. Collisions with enemies or mushrooms result in game over.

Controls:- 
Arrow keys: 
Spacebar: Fire bullets to hit enemies and mushrooms.
Escape: Exit the game.

This project demonstrates collision detection, game loop management, and SFML integration for graphics and audio. Perfect for learning game development basics or enjoying a retro gaming experience!

Requirements: SFML library, C++ compiler, and texture/audio files included in the repository.

NOTE: To play the game without setting up sfml in your system download the executable zip file and run the exe file.
